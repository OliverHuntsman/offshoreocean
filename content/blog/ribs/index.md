RIBs are great, a RIB was the first boat our family owned when my brothers and I were kids, in fact now with my own kids, I own one!

Our first one was 4 metres and had a 50HP Mercury on the back, today's is a 7 metre with a 225 HP Merc

But when I'm not on the inshore coastal waters in my RIB & the kids, I'm offshore, thats when it gets serious. 
Weapon of choice is a [37' Invincible Catamaran](https://invincibleboats.com/37-catamaran/#:~:text=A%20twin%2Dhulled%2C%20twin%2D,you%20expect%20from%20an%20Invincible.) with Quad 400 Mercs.

Now this is where it gets a bit weird - there are these new luxry RIBs - you've seen them. generally 10metres plus. A bit of faux teak. Maybe an inboard. classy on the inside, then they lose all that style & loads of space with this big ol' bumper on the outside, the same one we used like a bumper car when we were kids. 

Or they've got and this weird bumper welded onto the side of a perfectly normal boat, just beacuse, well, it's a RIB - has the captain not learnt how to dock yet? Did they not go through that bumper car stage as a kid? I guess that remains to be seen!

So here it is. If you're 12, or your kids are - buy a RIB - if you're not, grow up, get serious and buy a Center Console
