The Cannes Festival of Yachting is one of the most highly-anticipated events in the yachting world, drawing in enthusiasts and industry professionals from all over the globe. In September 2022, the International Team at Invincible was tasked with bringing a customer's 37' Catamaran boat, which was bound for Abu Dhabi, from the factory in Opa Locka, Miami Florida to Livorno in Italy.

The journey began with the boat being shipped to Livorno on a US flag charter ship. This meant that it was on board with US military vehicles, and the route was full due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Despite the challenges, the boat arrived safely in Livorno, where the team would take her over the open ocean for about 250 nautical miles to Cannes for the Yachting Festival.

Just after dropping the boat into the water at the port, the team dispensed of the hire car and set their course for Positano for some amazing photo opportunities and an overnight stay in a gorgeous boutique hotel. The local seafood was said to be absolutely delicious, making for a memorable pit stop.

With the 37' Catamaran fully fuelled, the team set off for Cannes and put the drone in the air, capturing some incredible footage that can be seen on Invincible's Youtube channel. They made a short stop for lunch in Italy before passing Monaco and changing the courtesy flag for French waters. The coastline along the journey was said to be truly breathtaking, with some of the most picturesque views of the Mediterranean.

As they approached Cannes, the team encountered some trouble finding a berth as the marina in Cannes had been evacuated to make way for the boats in the show and many boats were preparing for their arrival at the Yachting Festival. After some frantic calls, they were able to secure a berth in St Tropez for two nights. On the first day of show setup, they met with Michael Hardicker from Xscape Marine to deck out their hospitality area and prepare the berth.

Michael, an Invincible Dealer for the Western Mediterranean region and a colleague the team has worked with over the past two decades, helped everything came together perfectly for a first-class show of the first 37' Catamaran in Europe. The team was even visited by a very special VIP, Mr AlMansoori.

Throughout the show, there were sea trials with the amazing Motor Yacht Kismet moored in the bay. It was clear that Invincible's 37' Catamaran was the premier boat in the show for performance, ride and efficiency. As the show drew to a close, the team packed up and headed for their final port of call in Europe with the beloved 37' Catamaran - Genoa - where it would be loaded and shipped to its new owner, Mr Al Mansoori.

Overall, the journey from Miami to Cannes was a true test of the team's skills and determination, but it was all worth it to showcase their incredible 37' Catamaran at one of the most prestigious yachting events in the world. The team at Invincible is proud of their hard work and dedication, and they're looking forward to many more successful journeys to come.
