description: This week we catch up with Oliver Huntsman from the Offshore Ocean and Invincible International Team

### What has been happening today VLOG

My view is that Offshore Ocean is a media company that pushes Invincible but can also list American Center Consoles.


The goal for this site is to be fast and lightweight without being too complicated. We need to have rapid feedback loops as to whether or not this is something which we can perceive as likely to succeed.

With my new office setup, I've got a good space to make videos like the following quickly and easily.

Oliver's VLOG test [YouTube](https://youtu.be/mDmH7sr1Ad0) (Click and watch) further development will embed the YouTube video into the website.

Positioning wise we need to think about how we can do this as IBCI and OO. I think this should be a media company that blatantly pushes our agenda for Invincible International and other trade that we do.

I'd really like to do a Podcast where we Zoom or film when we're together and just talk conversationally about some news that's happened in the week - "We just shipped a 39' to Seychelles, did you see in IBI that MasterCraft had their best year for earnings - good news they needed it! I just don't understand where Azimut have gone - they're basically building a boat with the performance of a pontoon yet suggesting with the design that they've shoehorned in that it can cruise! And it just falls apart!!" Etc
I think we can do more to leverage our existing activities by just recording and publishing.

I've been putting together a series of briefs to work with a developer and a UI designer - the cost will be about Â£2.5k and the delivery will be in about 2 weeks. I've worked with the people before so am happy they can deliver in the given timescale.
I'd like to be able to walk up to various dealers at FLIBS and say we have a listing site - open yourself up to the global market and protect yourself from Interest Rate Rises happening domestically, all you'll have to do is detail and shrinkwrap and we'll take care of the rest.


Here are the website briefs I have at the moment:-
